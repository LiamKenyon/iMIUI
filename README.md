&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;a href="http://en.miui.com/" target="_blank">&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-95 alignleft" alt="about_miui" src="http://onehalfkiller.com/imiui/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-05-at-10.31.25-253x300.png" width="253" height="300" />&lt;/a>Pronounced "me-you-eye", MIUI was originally developed by &lt;a href="http://www.xiaomi.com/" target="_blank">Xiaomi Tech&lt;/a> as a ROM for Android. The latest version, v5, was released earlier this year is critically acclaimed specifically for it's aesthetics and ease of use, and is often described as "iOS-like". As one of the most popular ROMS for Android, it began as a small Chinese-only piece of software but is now available in many languages, supported in multiple forums, usually updated every Friday and is the default software of many Xiaomi smartphones.&lt;/p> &lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;a href="http://en.miui.com/">Click here to visit the Official MIUI website&lt;/a>&lt;/p> &lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;a href="http://en.miui.com/love.html">&lt;img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://en.miui.com/extra/1000/images/c_en.png" width="113" height="124" />&lt;/a>Xiaomi revealed in February that MIUI is being used by 10 000 000 people, where a celebratory theme "MIUILove" was released and 0.1 RMB is being donated to the Smile Angel Foundation for every download, which currently exceeds 1 000 000.&lt;/p> &lt;p style="text-align: center;">&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXM7QmgM7yc" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0">&lt;/iframe>&lt;/p> &lt;p style="text-align: justify;">Since then, there have been many imitations of MIUI on iOS - although due to restrictions, these are no more than themes whereas on Android, new system features and improvements to the OS can be made. Nevertheless, we believe there is still a gap in terms of a complete MIUI port, hence the release of iMIUI. We have aimed to produce a theme that covers all bases - nothing has been left to chance and all aesthetics are created using our best efforts. We thoroughly hope the wait has been worth it and that you enjoy your iMIUI experience!&lt;/p> &lt;p style="text-align: justify;">&lt;/p>
